#pharmacy_count
This repo is for insight data_engineering track question
Every Id name medicine and cost are given in each line of the input data
The top cost of the medicines are sorted and given in python code

#Problem

Imagine you are a data engineer working for an online pharmacy. You are asked to generate a list of all drugs, the total number of UNIQUE individuals who prescribed the medication, and the total drug cost, which must be listed in descending order based on the total drug cost and if there is a tie, drug name.

#Output : program needs to create the output file, top_cost_drug.txt, that contains comma (,) separated fields in each line.

Each line of this file should contain these fields:

drug_name: the exact drug name as shown in the input dataset
num_prescriber: the number of unique prescribers who prescribed the drug. For the purposes of this challenge, a prescriber is considered the same person if two lines share the same prescriber first and last names
total_cost: total cost of the drug across all prescribers



#The directory structure for your repo should look like this:

    ├── README.md 
    ├── run.sh
    ├── src
    │   └── pharmacy-counting.py
    ├── input
    │   └── itcont.txt
    ├── output
    |   └── top_cost_drug.txt
    ├── insight_testsuite
        └── run_tests.sh
        └── tests
            └── test_1
            |   ├── input
            |   │   └── itcont.txt
            |   |__ output
            |   │   └── top_cost_drug.txt
            ├── your-own-test_1
                ├── input
                │   └── your-own-input-for-itcont.txt
                |── output
                    └── top_cost_drug.txt

**Don't fork this repo** and don't use this `README` instead of your own. The content of `src` does not need to be a single file called `pharmacy-counting.py`, which is only an example. Instead, you should include your own source files and give them expressive names.

## Testing your directory structure and output format

To make sure that your code has the correct directory structure and the format of the output files are correct, we have included a test script called `run_tests.sh` in the `insight_testsuite` folder.

The tests are stored simply as text files under the `insight_testsuite/tests` folder. Each test should have a separate folder with an `input` folder for `itcont.txt` and an `output` folder for `top_cost_drug.txt`.

You can run the test with the following command from within the `insight_testsuite` folder:

    insight_testsuite~$ ./run_tests.sh 

On a failed test, the output of `run_tests.sh` should look like:

    [FAIL]: test_1
    [Thu Mar 30 16:28:01 PDT 2017] 0 of 1 tests passed

On success:

    [PASS]: test_1
    [Thu Mar 30 16:25:57 PDT 2017] 1 of 1 tests passed
One test has been provided as a way to check your formatting and simulate how we will be running tests when you submit your solution. We urge you to write your own additional tests. `test_1` is only intended to alert you if the directory structure or the output for this test is incorrect.
